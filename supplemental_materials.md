# Extra resources
Feel free to extend this with anything you've got. Some of what I have here are lists of resources. For the rest, I'm going to prepend what I add with a 1, 2 or 3.

1. I haven't read this yet
2. I read this
3. I read this and I think it is great

My hope is that we can all extend this document, and that whenever we're feeling curious we can dive into whatever seems interesting.

# Python
* (list) Python has a curated list of beginner resources, don't be afraid to try them out and see if you can find one you like: https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/
* (3) byte of Python can be done in a saturday afternoon and will help you a lot if this is your first time working with Python. I strongly suggest trying every single exercise on your own machine. There are certain things that can't be explained in words alone, and programming is one of them: https://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python
